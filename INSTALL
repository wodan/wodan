Installation
---------------

I. First, you will need the necessary files:

    1. The apache 2.x webserver source
    2. The Wodan source

II. Unpack Apache and Wodan sources somewhere (e.g. /usr/local/src):
    1. Apache
    
        $ tar zxvf apache-2.x.tar.gz    
    
    2. Wodan
    
        $ tar zxvf wodan-2.x.tar.gz
    
III. Build Apache

    Build Apache with mod_so enabled. This enables Apache to load dynamic
    modules. The configure line below will enable mod_so, and configure
    Apache to be installed in /usr/local/apache_wodan

    $ cd <source_of_apache>
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache_wodan --enable-module=so
    $ make

    Of course, if you don't like the installation location, you are encouraged
    to change it.

IV. Installing apache

    $ su
    # make install

V.  Build Wodan

    Wodan is built using Apache's apxs tool and autoconf. First, you have to
    run the configure script to create a Makefile. You have to supply the
    directory that Apache was installed in to the configure script. You can also
    enable the use of SSL (HTTPS) backends using the 'enable-ssl-backend' option.

    $ ./configure --with-apache=/usr/local/apache_wodan

    will configure the use of the Apache installation in /usr/local/apache_wodan.
    If there's no Apache installation in that directory, an error message will
    be displayed.

    $ ./configure --with-apache=/usr/local/apache_wodan --enable-ssl-backend

    will do the same as above, but will enable the reverse proxying of
    SSL enabled backends. An installation of SSL (OpenSSL) will be searched
    and used if found. If no SSL installation is found, an error message is
    displayed.

    After running the configure script, run

    $ make

    if this is succesful, run

    $ make install

    This will also take care of loading the mod_wodan.so module in httpd.conf.
    Apache with Wodan is now ready to be configured and run!
